## Todo List
- Get register form to create file
- javascript for random image placement
- make modal sexy (or decide that model window is bad UI)
- make form be good looking, [like this](https://gph.is/2fcY04D)
  - Does it make the most sense to animate the labels animating with css transforms? 
  - How do we style selects? Can we use CSS or do we have to use a JS workaround?

- result filtering (in progress)
- omen page (in progress)
